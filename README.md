### Alfred

Alfred recommends syncing with Dropbox. For now, all Alfred data is stored in this repository at [/Alfred](/Alfred) for simplicity of migrating on a new computer. If this becomes infeasible, I can always move this back to Dropbox folder syncing.

### Applications

TODO. Maybe see what can be installed by homebrew, and track the dep list in this repo.
