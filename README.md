## Installation

1. Clone the repo to `~/dotfiles`
2. Check [bootstrap.sh](bootstrap.sh) and [Brewfile](Brefile) for any commented out lines from past computers
3. Run `./bootstrap.sh`

#### You might need to...

1. Check Karabiner Elements and make sure its folders in the `~/.config` directory are correctly using the files in this repo
   - [bin/sync.sh](bin/sync.sh) might be able to help with that
2. Make sure the Bartender app is running correctly (enter in License Key from Bitwarden)
3. Follow any other instructions below

### macOS Preferences

The macOS setup script tries to set all necessary preferences as best it can, but there's a few essential things it doesn't work work with yet. Maybe we'll fix those one day, but for now just go and manually check these.

- Turn off Spotlight keyboard shortcut (Alfred instead). `System Preferences` > `Keyboard` > `Shortcuts` > `Spotlight` > Uncheck spotlight search

### Rectangle

1. Open Rectangle's preferences
2. Add a keybinding for "Almost Maximize" (e.g. `ctrl+opt+cmd+â†©`), if desired

<details>
   This is done here because this keybinding changes a plist option where it's some data array, and I don't know exactly how to modify that correctly.
</details>

### Bartender

As of writing this, there's a Bartender 4 update that is only for Big Sur+. Because of the unknown of that, when setting up just set up Bartender manually. Maybe at that time, run the pref diffs and add them to the macos setup script as necessary.

### Terminal

1. Open Terminal
2. Open `Preferences > Profile`
3. Drag [macos/terminal-theme.terminal](macos/terminal-theme.terminal) into the pane with all of the profiles
4. Select the font to be `Dank Mono Regular`, `18 pt.`
5. Elsewhere in preferences, set that to be the default theme and window

<details>
   Terminal's preferences are weird and nested, and I don't want to deal with that right now, and who knows, maybe I switch to iTerm one day ðŸ˜…. So this is fine for now.
</details>

### Alfred

Alfred recommends syncing with Dropbox. For now, all Alfred data is stored in this repository at [/Alfred](/Alfred) for simplicity of migrating on a new computer. If this becomes infeasible, I can always move this back to Dropbox folder syncing.

When starting Alfred for the first time, you'll need to point it to the files in this repo. To do so, open Alfred's preferences > `Appearance` > `Set preferences folderâ€¦` and select `<DOTFILES_REPO_PATH>/Alfred`

### Keyboard

Keyboard remapping is done with the Karabiner-Elements app.

This app is installed through homebrew-cask within the `bootstrap.sh` file, but needs some additional configuration:

<hr />

- There are files tracked in `.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications`. Not sure yet if these will get overwritten upon installing the app. If they do, then just copy-paste them from this repo back to where they're supposed to be.

<hr />

1. Open the Karabiner-Elements app.
2. Open the `Complex modifications` tab.
3. Click `Add rule` button (bottom left)
4. Enable the following rules:
   - `Change caps_lock to control if pressed with other keys, to escape if pressed alone.`
   - `Toggle caps_lock by pressing left_shift + right_shift at the same time`
     - NOTE: Neither of these solutions seem to turn on the keyboard light for external keyboards. If you want to try and tackle this, check out [this tutorial](https://robin.lauren.fi/posts/map-caps-lock-to-ctrl-or-escape/#:~:text=Open%20the%20%E2%80%9CComplex%20Modifications%E2%80%9D%20tab,alone%20and%20you're%20done!)

<hr />

As of writing this, there's weird behavior between mac keybinding remappings (done through the `Preferences` app) and Karabiner with this configuration, where the option and command keys can't be swapped on external keyboards. If that's the case...

1. Open the Karabiner-Elements app
2. Open the `Simple modifications` tab
3. Add 4 mappings for swapping command and option (e.g. `left_command` to `left_option`)

<hr />

#### Function keys w/ Touch Bar

If using a mac with a touch bar, and opting for the control strip by default and function keys when holding `fn`, you'll need to make this modification [shown here](/assets/fn-key-remap.png).

<details>
   The reason this is necessary is that Karabiner thinks you're holding down `fn` and hitting a `f*` key, which the checkbox at the bottom says that it should use the "special feature" for that `f*` key.
</details>

### Font

For use in VS Code, download the [Dank Mono](https://gumroad.com/l/dank-mono) font (the confirmation/link to the actual asset should be in your email somewhere)
