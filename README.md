## Installation

> NEXT_MACHINE: Try step 2 on its own. If it works, take a note of that, and maybe make a to-do that simplifies this (i.e. remove step 1, run those commands in `bootstrap.sh`, only run those commands once by putting some kind of flag into `.zshrc\_\_private, etc.)

1. On a brand new installation of macOS:

<!-- softwareupdate: Updates and installs Apple software (like Safari, macOS, etc.) -->
<!-- xcode-select: Installs dev tools (like git, make, etc.) -->

- `sudo softwareupdate -i -a`
- `xcode-select --install`

2. Install: `` bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babramczyk/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`" ``
1. `cd ~/src/personal/dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh`
1. Add any sensitive data to [.zshrc\_\_private](.zshrc__private) (find them in your password manager)

```shell
export __a_secret=
```

6. `macos/dock.sh` (sets up the dock for the first time on a new machine)

<!-- TODO: Automate this -->

2. Put this at the top of `/private/etc/pam.d/sudo`: `auth sufficient pam_tid.so`. This allows TouchID instead of a password for sudo
1. Follow any other instructions below

## Post-Installation üî®

I try to automate everything I can, but here's everything I haven't yet, or maybe don't ever want to, or maybe it's just too early to tell if these are evergreen yet.

### One-offs 1Ô∏è‚É£

- Turn off Spotlight keyboard shortcut (Alfred instead). `System Preferences` > `Keyboard` > `Shortcuts` > `Spotlight` > Uncheck spotlight search
- Save Trello (and Slack) as "apps" from Chrome (overflow menu > `More Tools` > `Create shortcut‚Ä¶` > check `Open as new window`)
- Rectangle ‚óªÔ∏è: Open up Rectangle, and set its keybindings and preferences to what you're used to
- Bartender Ô∏èüç∏: Open up Bartneder, and configure it how you'd like it

### Keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è

Keyboard remapping is done with the Karabiner-Elements app.

- [ ] Open up the Karabiner-Elements app > `Profile` > Rename the default to `Goku`.

<!-- NOTE: Remapping for external "non-Mac" keyboards is currently done on a one-off basis for my particular mechanical keyboard (Karabiner stores product and vendor IDs). If you ever switch keyboards, you'll need to manually **swap the `opt` and `command` keys just for that keyboard** -->

### Alfred üé©

- [ ] Make sure Alfred and its workflows have proper OS access. In Alfred's preferences, go to `General` > `Permissions` > `Request Permissions`, and let Alfred guide you üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- [ ] Exclude all `node_modules` from Spotlight: `System Preferences` > `Spotlight` > `Privacy`: Drag folders from Finder into the drop area. You can easily find these by triggering Alfred and querying for `node_modules`

### Font üî†

For use in VS Code and your terminal:

1. Download the [Dank Mono](https://gumroad.com/l/dank-mono) font (link to download it is in your password manager)
1. Extract and open the downloaded zip
1. Open the `OpenType-PS` directory
1. Double click on all the fonts, and click `Install Font` for each

### Terminal üíª

1. Open Terminal
1. Open `Preferences > Profile`
1. Drag [macos/terminal-theme.terminal](macos/terminal-theme.terminal) into the pane with all of the profiles
1. Select the font to be `Dank Mono Regular`, `18 pt.`
1. Elsewhere in preferences, set that to be the default theme and window

<details>
   Terminal's preferences are weird and nested, and I don't want to deal with that right now, and who knows, maybe I switch to iTerm one day üòÖ. So this is fine for now.

### GitHub üêô

To authenticate with GitHub from the command line...

- [ ] Follow the [instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to create a personal access token (you'll need to do this, since having 2FA enabled on your GitHub account prevents you from using username+password from the CLI).
  - [ ] Copy the generated token
- [ ] Go to any repo that's been cloned for you in `~/src/personal/`
  - [ ] Make a small change and commit it
  - [ ] `git push`
  - [ ] Use your GitHub username (not email), and the token for the password

You should now be properly authenticated for future requests to GitHub.
